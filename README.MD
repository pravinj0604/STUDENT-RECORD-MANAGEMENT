# STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT

## PROBLEM: 
- Manual student data management is inefficient and lacks persistence. A structured system was needed to handle operations like add, search, update, and delete while maintaining data between sessions.
## SOLUTION:
- Developed a menu-driven system in C that uses file handling for persistent storage and data structures for efficient organization, supporting basic CRUD operations and prepared for future database integration.
## IMPLEMENTATION:
- Menu interface for user interaction. Used structures to store student data. File handling used to save and load data. Functions implemented: Add, Search, Update, Delete.
